# Diagnostic and Testing Tools

This directory contains tools for diagnosing issues and testing the bot:

- `ai_diagnostics.py` - Diagnostics for AI analysis functionality
- `performance_dashboard.py` - Performance monitoring and dashboard
- `stress_test.py` - Stress testing for high load scenarios

These tools are meant for development and troubleshooting purposes, not for regular bot operation.
